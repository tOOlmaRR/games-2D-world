# 2-D World RPG
## Summary
Initial plans here is to build a 2D RPG game based on a few exercises completed in a few eLearning courses and other ideas that have been floating around in my head for years.

## Features
1. 2-D World - a small JS console app that generates a 2-D world and allows you to move around within that world.
1. Turn-based Fight - a small JS console app that simulates a fight between two characters
1. Wall Siege - a smmall game in which the user can define a wall and some dragons and simulate an attack on the wall

## Currently Known Bugs and Limitations
TBD

## History

### v1.0
- first commits to GitHub, and thus, public availability
- the three pieces from which I plan to build this game are in a similar state to where it was at the end of completing the lessons in [this JavaScript eLearning course](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-basics-start-coding-in-5-minutes-2019/learn/) from which it was originally built.
